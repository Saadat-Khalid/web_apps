# Image Classification (CIFAR10) with Streamlit

This project demonstrates how to create a Streamlit web application for image classification using a pre-trained deep learning model. Users can upload an image, and the application will classify it into one of the predefined classes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via `pip`):
  - streamlit
  - opencv-python-headless
  - tensorflow
  - matplotlib

You also need a pre-trained image classification model saved in HDF5 format (`.h5`) to load into the application. You can train your model using the provided code or use an existing model.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run cifar10_image_classifier_web_app.py.py
```

This command will start a local web server and open the application in your default web browser. You can now upload an image to the application, and it will classify the image using your pre-trained model.
